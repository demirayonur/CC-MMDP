# CC-MMDP

The deterministic mixed integer programming equivalent `(MIP-MMDP)`, the so-called extensive-form, of the 2-stage stochastic integer programming model developed for Capacity Constrained Multi-model Markov Decision Processes `(CC-MMDP)` is implemented in Java programming language, and solved by CPLEX 12.10. It is optional to use Benders decomposition and the proposed valid inequalities. We also provide a parallel approximate dynamic programing `(PADP)` algorithm to get a good approximation to the optimal solution in reasonable time spans.

`(MIP-MMDP)` is a novel formulation, which converts the traditional MDP model with known parameters and no capacity constraints to a new model with uncertain parameters and a resource capacity constraint. The motivation behind `(CC-MMDP)` and the technical details related to `(MIP-MMDP)` and `(PADP)` are explained in detail in the following paper:

## 1. Data

The data generated by the Monte Carlo approach described in the paper are provided in the `Data` folder under which there are distinct folders for each scenario. What a scenario folder includes is nothing but just 3 *.csv* files to characterize the associated MDP components. *P.csv* consists of the transition probabilities among non-absorbing states, *Q.csv* includes the transition probabilities from non-absorbing states to the only absorbing state in the model, and *r.csv* stands for the immediate rewards. It is worth to mention the caveat that these .csv files are flattened before writing. Thus, it is necessary to reshape them after they are read. 

In order to create an MDP object from a scenario, it is enough to create an appropriate HashMap and use the construction method with the one taking the HashMap as an argument. Following is an example of how you can read the MDP from the file called `scenario_1`:

```java
String path_ = "your_path/Data/scenario_1/" // you should introduce the specific path of the Data folder in your own local
HashMap<String, String> csvFiles = new HashMap<String, String>();
csvFiles.put("P", path_ + "P.csv");
csvFiles.put("Q", path_ + "Q.csv");
csvFiles.put("r", path_ + "r.csv");
MDP our_mdp = new MDP(csvFiles);
```
